# Static Structural Analysis of a Load-Bearing Bracket (ANSYS Workbench)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project presents a static structural finite element analysis (FEA) of a mechanical load-bearing bracket using ANSYS Workbench. The objective is to evaluate deformation, equivalent (von Mises) stress, and factor of safety (FOS) under a downward load of 2000 N and to compare the structural performance of four commonly used engineering materials.

## 🧩 Geometry & Boundary Conditions
- Component: Mechanical Bracket
- Load Applied: 2000 N (downward direction)
- Constraints: Four mounting holes fully fixed
- Analysis Type: Linear Static Structural Analysis

## 🛠 Software Used
- ANSYS Workbench (Static Structural)
- SolidWorks (CAD modeling & drawing)

## 🧪 Materials Studied
1. Structural Steel  
2. Aluminum 6061-T1  
3. Stainless Steel 304 (Annealed)  
4. Ti-6Al-4V ELI  

Material properties were assigned based on standard engineering data.

## 📊 Results Summary

### Structural Steel
- Max Deformation: 1.0818 × 10⁻² mm
- Max Equivalent Stress: 72.427 MPa
- Minimum Factor of Safety: 3.4518

### Aluminum 6061-T1
- Max Deformation: 3.1538 × 10⁻² mm
- Max Equivalent Stress: 70.497 MPa
- Minimum Factor of Safety: 3.6172

### Stainless Steel 304 (Annealed)
- Max Deformation: 1.0784 × 10⁻² mm
- Max Equivalent Stress: 73.662 MPa
- Minimum Factor of Safety: 3.1224

### Ti-6Al-4V ELI
- Max Deformation: 1.9728 × 10⁻² mm
- Max Equivalent Stress: 71.152 MPa
- Minimum Factor of Safety: 12.227

## ✅ Conclusion
All materials were found to be structurally safe under the applied load. Aluminum 6061-T1 showed the highest deformation due to its lower modulus, while Ti-6Al-4V ELI provided the highest factor of safety, making it suitable for high-strength, weight-critical applications.
